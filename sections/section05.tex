\section{Experiments and Results}
In this section we will cover the overhead incurred as result of using a dynamic 
scheduling module under SwS module of the Autosar framework.
The common cost of scheduling including the cost of schedule table creation, Context 
switch overhead as well as removing and restoring of the lower criticality tasks 
during criticality change are studied.
