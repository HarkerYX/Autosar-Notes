\section{On the Scheduling of Mixed-Criticality Real-Time Task Sets}

\subsection*{Main Idea}
This paper introduces the concept of Zero slack scheduling, In zero slack scheduling the task consist of two execution modes: normal and critical. When a task is unable to meet its budget demands in normal mode, it switches to critical mode at the last instance at which it is able to meet the demand in critical mode.
