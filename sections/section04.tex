\section{Adaptive Variable Tasks}
\subsection{Elastic task model for Adaptive Rate Control}
A novel periodic task model is proposed in which tasks periods are provided with elastic coefficients. Under this approach tasks can change there execution rate to provide different Quality of Service(QoS).
To simplify the schedulability analysis simple assumptions are taken, as is the case with RM and EDF. For which tasks with cyclic execution and fixed demand are considered.
But this assumption are too restrictive for application for which timing constraints can be more flexible and dynamic.
Works have been done to done theoretical support to such tasks using probabilistic guarantee, capacity reservation based approach or by providing an upper bound on the job chains with variable executions.
Varying tasks rate provides the possibility of handling a graceful task degradation rather than outright rejection of some tasks.
A number of approaches have been proposed for dynamic and static load balancing to handle overload conditions. In \textit{"QoS Negotiation  in  Real-Time Systems  and  Its  Applications to Automated Flight Control"} QoS is proposed as a set of negotiation options based on reward and rejection penalties.\\
This Paper tries to propose a generic way for tasks to change there execution rates and provide varying QoS under different condition.
The elastic task model works by compressing the taskset under overload condition. The compression of tasks is handled depending upon the elastic coefficient \textit{e}. Another advantage of elastic task model is when considering a new task into otherwise schedulable task set. Under a rigid task model this will not be feasible, but by using elastic task compression the new task could be accommodated.\\
The basic algorithm used to tune the elastic tasks is given below:

\subsection{Towards runtime adaptation in AUTOSAR}
This paper put forwards a method to extend the AUTOSAR mode management to implement runtime adaptation.
To realize runtime adaptation in AUTOSAR relocation of software components at runtime is required, which in turn is based on computation of adaptations during runtime.
To meet the Adaptation requirements the new model tries to meet to following challenges.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Real time requirements.
	\item Self describing components.
	\item Scheduling.
	\item ECU Independent addressing.
\end{itemize}
The runtime adaptation is implemented by two components: Adaptation Service and Adaptation Manager.
Relocating software requires control over starting and stopping of AUTOSAR Software Components, this is done by extending the system by a runtime control based on MAPE(Monitor, ANalyze, Plan and Execute) cycle.

\end{minipage}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Monitoring Mechanism} : Monitoring unit extends the mode manager. A request to change the mode to meet the new requirements is initiated to Mode Manager.
	\item \textbf{Analyze}: Mode manager does the analyze and planning phase. A single adaptation manager can exist in entire automotive network or to properly extend Mode manager, one Adaptation Manager shal exist per ECU. This also has the added benefit of redundancy avoiding single point of failure.
	\item \textbf{Synchronization Mechanism}: Mode Manager shall notify the Synchronization manager of the changed execution and will synchronize it across the ECUs in network.
	\item \textbf{Real-Time requirements}: The Adaptation mechanism implemented shall always be determined with respect to the component timing requirement.
	\item \textbf{Self-Describing components}: In order to check for the timing requirements the components shall publish the attributes needed for runtime verification such as end to end deadline.
	\item Scheduling: EDF Scheduling to provide better efficiency.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Fast and Tight Analysis of AUTOSAR Schedule Tables.}
Proposes how to quantify the response time of the schedule table driven task set considering the offset and resource based priority threshold interference.
Two different analysis of rta and maximum time to release of a given task under a given time frame \textit{t}, as well as maximum time to completion of the given task is put forward.
First method being tight fit while the second method is an approximate estimation of the above mentioned parameters.
\subsection{Evaluation and Implementation of Mixed-Criticality Scheduling Approaches for Periodic Tasks}
The paper proposes a quantitative comparison of MC Approaches including: Priority assignment, Period transformation and Zero-slack scheduling.
Zero slack scheduling is improved by addressing two previously known issues: How to accommodate execution of a task after its deadline and how to handle previously unknown interferences.

\subsection{Towards the design of certifiable mixed-criticality systems.}
